\declareIM{g}{G}{2021-06-30}{AOS using ComCam, commanding MT}{AOS CC/MT}

Executive Summary:

Perform wave-front sensing using ComCam and a notebook

\textbf{Does not map to P6}

\subsection{Goals of IM}
Demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Slew to field, generating telemetry (\cf \IM{f})
\item piston camera (e.g. in, -out, in, +out, in). \XXX{five exposures at each position}
\item take data using ComCam in playback mode, commanded from OCS
\item uses \gls{OCPS} to reduce data on commissioning cluster
\item load Zernikes into \gls{EFD}
\item Use MTAOS to update state of optics
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item ability to control camera hexapod
\item \IM{pg}
\item \IM{f}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item No need for replaying corner raft data
  \end{itemize}
\item notebook/script to perform pistoning of camera hexapod with image acquisition
\item \gls{OCPS}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate simulated images with desired pistons (e.g. $[0, -10, 0, 10, 0]$) and appropriate
  metadata and load into comCam
\item Use \gls{scriptQueue} to issue slew and camera commands, sending commands to \gls{OCPS}
      to process the data.  \Nb will require the \gls{AOS} to synchronise the piston values
      with the OCPS exposure numbers (\texttt{seqNum}).
\item Check that desired events are in the EFD
\end{itemize}
