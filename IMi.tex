Executive Summary:

Simulate AOS commissioning, including building LUTs with LSSTCam

\textbf{Maps to SUMMIT-3075 - "Build Operational LSSTCam-Tel AOS Look-up Tables"}

Outstanding questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Are we verifying anything here?
\item Should this be split into two IMs?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Goals of IM}
Demonstrate running full AOS functionality script at 3 elevations
\begin{itemize}
\item scriptQueue runs SAL script
  \begin{itemize}
  \item pistons camera (in, -out, in, +out, in)
  \item uses \gls{OCPS} to reduce data on commissioning cluster
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Returns Zernikes
    \end{itemize}
  \item Script awaits on \gls{OCPS} reduction finishing
  \item AOS uses returned Zernikes to calculate mirror offsets as part of loop
  \item Applies offsets and repeat
  \item in-focus images get sent off via \gls{OCPS} for reduction
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Build LUT for each mirror and hexapod
\item Load the LUTs into components
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Ideally would use new configuration handling tstn-017
  \end{itemize}
\item Repeat elevation testing with new LUTs
  \begin{itemize}
  \item results should show zero WFE
  \end{itemize}
\item Analysis should be repeated at NCSA
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item IM\(_{\text{f}}\)
\end{itemize}
