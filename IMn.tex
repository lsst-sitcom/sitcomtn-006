\declareIM{n}{N}{2022-01-01}{``DRP'' Imaging Campaign with AuxTel}{DRP with auxTel}

Executive Summary:

Carry out an imaging campaign using the auxTel, reducing the data in Chile, and
carrying out suitable validation on the Mountain

\subsection{Goals of IM}
Demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Running auxTel using the scheduler
\item Generating near-realtime feedback to the observers, using OCPS and FAFF-defined displays
\item Reducing data on commissioning cluster to at least full single-frame processing, and probably coadds.
\item Generating templates for \IM{o}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item The commissioning cluster
\item \IM{pn}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item proc A
\item proc Z
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Acceptance Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Processing of data and generation of science performance metrics is accomplished with no human in the loop.
\item An observing specialist on the summit must be able to pull up a visualization of data quality from data acquired within the past hour.
\end{itemize}
