\declareIM{a}{1}{2021-01-08}{ComCam Image Capture and Archive}

Executive Summary:

Run ComCam from notebooks, with generation and certification of ComCam calibrations

\subsection{Goals of IM}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Taking ComCam images in Chile using nublado
	\item Taking calibration and other images using the \gls{scriptQueue}
	\item Automatic ingestion into a gen3 butler in Chile
	\item Transfer over \gls{DBB Buffer manager} and the \gls{LHN} to a gen3 repo on the \gls{RSP}
	\item Human generation and availability of master calibrations in Chile
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{ComCam on summit}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item cold and functional
		\item incoherent light source available to take flats
	\end{itemize}
	\item{gen3 butler ingestion for ComCam}
\item{Nublado running in Chile}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
The following procedure is to be executed by a general commissioning team member. The script creation and scriptQueue requires a minor amount of training and may require assistance.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Following a procedure, instantiate the OCS bridge
	\item Using Nublado, bring to enabled state using Notebook
	\item Using Nublado and the \href{https://ts-observatory-control.lsst.io/py-api/lsst.ts.observatory.control.maintel.ComCam.html}{ComCam class}:
	\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Take a single OBJECT, BIAS, FLAT, DARK image
 		\item For each image, monitor event for CCCamera completion, monitor \gls{OODS} event saying image is ready, use butler to grab image, display image locally using Firefly/DS9 or camera display tool
    \end{enumerate}	
	\item In a notebook, create cells to take bias, dark, flat, and PTC calibration data
	\item Convert Nublado cells to \gls{scriptQueue}, creating a ``standard Calibration'' script and execute them
	\item From the Commissioning Cluster at the base:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Display one of each image type locally using Firefly/DS9 or camera display tool
		\item Run gen3 \gls{cp_pipe} by hand from a Nublado terminal
    	\begin{enumerate}
    		\item Create master biases, flats, darks using ``auto-certify'' mode which assumes that the derived products are good \footnote{This results in the calibrations being available for use}
    		\item Copy images to summit and include in summit Butler repo.
    	\end{enumerate}
  	\end{enumerate}
 	\item Take further exposures with structured illumination, preferably different from what was used to generate the flat.
  	\item From the summit, run \gls{ISR} processing, display images and confirm new calibs are being applied
	\item Once data is synced to NCSA via the \gls{LHN}, Repeat the generation of calibration images using the \gls{RSP}
	\item Re-verify that \gls{RSP} generated calibration images can be used on the summit.
\end{enumerate}
