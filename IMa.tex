\declareIM{a}{1}{2021-01-08}{ComCam Image Capture and Archive}

Executive Summary:

Run ComCam from notebooks, with generation and certification of ComCam calibrations

\subsection{Goals of IM}
\label{sec:orgbea7b56}
\begin{itemize}
\item Taking ComCam images in Chile using nublado
\item Taking calibration and other images using the \gls{scriptQueue}
\item Automatic ingestion into a gen3 butler in Chile
\item Transfer over \gls{DBB Buffer manager} and the \gls{LHN} to a gen3 repo at NCSA
\item Human generation and availability of master calibrations in Chile
% \item EFD client access at NCSA
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item{ComCam on summit}
\begin{itemize}
\item cold and functional
\end{itemize}
\item{gen3 butler ingestion for comCam}
\item{Nublado running in Chile}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use nublado to take bias, dark, flat, and PTC calibration data
\item Convert nublado cells to \gls{scriptQueue} and run them
\item In Chile,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Run gen3 \gls{cp_pipe} by hand from a nublado terminal
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use ``auto-certify'' mode which assumes that the derived products are good
    \item \Nb this results in the calibs being available for further use
    \end{itemize}
  \item Take further exposures, if possible with structured illumination
  \item Run \gls{ISR} processing and confirm quality of resulting images
  \end{itemize}
\item Repeat these operations at NCSA
\end{itemize}
