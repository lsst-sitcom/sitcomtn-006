\section{Milestone Activity IM\(_{\text{f}}\): Corner raft AOS                     (2021-XX-YY)}
\label{sec:org56c5b30}
Executive Summary:

Use a notebook to process corner raft SW0/1 simulated data, publishing wavefront error events

\subsection{Goals of IM}

Demonstrate ability to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Slew to a field (only needed to provide ra, dec, rotator telemetry)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Question: does AOS need anything from the scheduler about the next field?
  \end{itemize}
\item Command exposure (or pair, if that's required by AOS) from ComCam
\item have MTAOS process images, triggered by appropriate events, and publish \{\{camera,m2\}Hexapod,\{m1m3,m2\}\}Correction events
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item Recover PhoSim images with donuts from ComCam
  \begin{itemize}
  \item we may need to fake something here, if ComCam cannot play back corner raft data
  \end{itemize}
\item Pointing component generating telemetry
\end{itemize}
