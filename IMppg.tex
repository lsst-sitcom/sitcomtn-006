\declareIM{ppg}{pre-pre-G}{2021-04-23}{Standalone ComCam AOS}
Executive Summary:
​
Demonstrate the processing of wave front images for ComCam from raw to Zernikes.

\textbf{Does not map to P6}
​
\subsection{Goals of IM}
​
Demonstrate ability to:
​
\begin{itemize}
\item Have MTAOS process images and generate Zernike coefficients
\end{itemize}
​
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item PhoSim images with donuts from ComCam ingested into a butler repo.
\item Working version of wavefront estimation pipeline (wep). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate and ingest simulated images with desired pistons (e.g. $[0, -10, 0, 10, 0]$) and appropriate
  metadata
\item Run a Gen-3 pipeline to read from the butler, run the ISR, process the donuts, and generate Zernikes.
\end{itemize}
