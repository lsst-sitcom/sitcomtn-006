\declareIM{pg}{pre-G}{2021-XX-YY}{Standalone ComCam AOS}
Executive Summary:
​
Process phosim Intra/Extra simulated ComCam images with the MTAOS.
Assuming that the images where acquired and ingested previously, drive the MTAOS through the data processing steps and produce corrections.
​
\subsection{Goals of IM}
​
Demonstrate ability to:
​
\begin{itemize}
\item Have MTAOS process images, triggered by appropriate commands, and publish
  \texttt{\{\{camera,m2\}Hexapod,\{m1m3,m2\}\}Correction} events
\end{itemize}
​
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item PhoSim images with donuts from ComCam ingested into a butler repo.
\item Working version of MTAOS with access to a butler repo containing simulated ingested data.
\item Working version of wavefront estimation pipeline (wep). 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate and ingest simulated images with desired pistons (e.g. $[0, -10, 0, 10, 0]$) and appropriate
  metadata
\item Manually issue commands to AOS system to process the data; in \IM{g} we will generate these
  commands from the \gls{scriptQueue}, triggered by \gls{OODS} events.
    \Nb we may need an extra config file for this IM providing information which will
    come from SAL in \IM{g}
\item Check that desired events are in the EFD
\end{itemize}
