\declareIM{pg}{pre-G}{2021-05-15}{Standalone ComCam AOS}
Executive Summary:
​
Process phosim Intra/Extra simulated ComCam images with the MTAOS.
Assuming that the images where acquired and ingested previously, drive the MTAOS through the data processing steps and produce corrections.

\textbf{Does not map to P6}
​
\subsection{Goals of IM}
​
Demonstrate ability to:
​
\begin{itemize}
\item Have MTAOS process images and publish
  \texttt{\{\{camera,m2\}Hexapod,\{m1m3,m2\}\}Correction} events
\end{itemize}
​
\subsection{Prerequisites}
\begin{itemize}
\item \IM{ppg}
\item Working version of MTAOS with access to a butler repo containing simulated ingested data.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Generate and ingest simulated images with desired pistons (e.g. $[0, -10, 0, 10, 0]$) and appropriate
  metadata
\item As for \IM{ppg} get data from the butler and generate Zernikes, using OCPS to run the pipeline
\item Trigger MTAOS to compute updates for Camera Hexapod, M2 Hexapod, M1M3, M2, 
\item Check that desired events are in the EFD
\end{itemize}
