\declareIM{pn}{pre-N}{DUE DATE}{Initial Imaging Campaign with AuxTel}{Pre-DRP AuxTel}

Executive Summary:

Collect multiband AuxTel imaging data over a roughly 1 square degree area with high stellar density.
Perform offline reduction and science validation of AuxTel imaging data at LDF and/or RSP, building towards the capability to automatically reduce data and provide near-realtime feedback to observers on the summit.

\subsection{Goals of IM}
Demonstrate:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run a multi-night AuxTel imaging survey using the scheduler
\item Reduce AuxTel imaging data through full single-frame processing steps: ISR and generation of calexps, source detection, and automated calculation and application of of photometric zeropoints, parquet format source tables;
\item Stretch goal to produce coadds and perform object detection
\item Compute several single-visit science performance metrics, as well as astrometric and photometric repeatability science performance metrics
\item Generate example data quality visualizations of pizel-level image data, catalog-level data, and science performance metrics trending that would be useful to summit observers using FAFF-defined displays
\item Access science performance metrics from the summit and rendezvous with EFD (e.g., compare DIMM seeing with delivered image quality)
