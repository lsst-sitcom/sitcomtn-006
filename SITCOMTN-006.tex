\section{Introduction}

The Rubin construction project is composed of three main subsystems: DM, Camera, and T\&S.\footnote{
  And also EPO, but this is probably not relevant here.}
but in operations there is only one survey.  The task of merging the projects is not easy, especially
when some of the interfaces are underspecified, or turn out to need modification based on experience.
This is primarily
a problem for the software --- the hardware interfaces, specified in mm and screw threads, are generally
well defined.

Once we accept that the only way to complete the integration of the subsystems is to actually integrate them,
while expecting that the interfaces and requirements will evolve, we recognise that our
situation is analogous to the
way that software development has moved from waterfall to agile development models.

This technote proposes that we introduce the concept of an \gls{IM} which defines
a specified set of functionalities that are available to the Rubin project.
This is slightly different from \gls{DM}'s
current \gls{OR} concept which tests the state of DM systems at a certain time rather than guaranteeing
continued cross-subsystem functionality.  I envisage that an \gls{IM} would be followed by an \gls{OR} to test
the deliverable, and to carry out an internal \gls{ORR} for the functionality delivered by the \gls{IM}.

  The dependencies between the IMs and other entities, either external hardware or software
  (\eg ComCam, Nublado shown in hexagons), or systems being produced during the completion
  of the Rubin system (\eg the \gls{OCPS}, shown in ellipses and whose first appearance
  is shown as a green line).
  The rectangular boxes are IMs; red means complete.  The blue arrows show IM's prerequisites,
  and black arrows indicate other dependencies.

  Not all IMs are shown at this point.  The mapping to P6 is also omitted as it is not
  yet clear enough to be useful (but see App. \ref{sec:P6Milestones}).

    \hline
    \IM{a} & \IMsummary{a} & \IMdate{a} \\

    \IM{h} & \IMsummary{h} & \IMdate{h} \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Those are pretty aggressive dates, but they are completed \textit{just} before we 
put ComCam on the TMA (without mirrors).

\section{Mapping to Milestones in P6}
\label{sec:P6Milestones}

This list of project milestones comes from
\href{https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62263966}{this page}
on confluence; the descriptions are summarised from the same page.  We omit
\textit{Integrate ComCam on Hexapod-Rotator and Install on TMA},
\textit{Technical Operations Optimization 1-3},
and
\textit{Engineering Punch-list Resolution} milestones.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  TCS functional testing of ComCam configuration (Load in guider and WFS applications, check high level functionality/operation without data acquisition )
\item
  CCS functional testing of ComCam - configuration update, shutter testing, filter changer, temperature control, data acquisition, data display, setup of trending analysis. Most of these have to be done as a function of telescope position
\end{itemize}

\item Attempt ingestion into pipelines to verify header service/EFD access (captured in CPP activity)
\item Test base-facility connection loss/recovery
\item Test base-facility to NCSA connection loss/recovery
