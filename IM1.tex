\section{IM1}


My proposed first IM would be to integrate comCam in La Serena.  This means:
\begin{itemize}
   \item running comCam reliably in Chile
   \begin{itemize}
       \item without logging into CCS machines
       \item integrating camera-side monitoring into Rubin operations
       \item writing files the way that we plan to in operations (i.e. directly from CCS)
   \end{itemize}
   \item taking data using the OCS
       \begin{itemize}
          \item writing telemetry to the EFD
          \item using a logging system (which Frossie is designing for SITCOM); no use of \eg eTraveller
          \item using the script queue
          \begin{itemize}
             \item In particular calibration sets: bias, dark, flat, PTC
          \end{itemize}
          \item using LOVE to see monitor operations
       \item using OCPS (OCS driven Data Processing; DMTN-133) to process data in Chile
       \begin{itemize}
          \item need to understand interaction with the diagnostic cluster
       \end{itemize}
       \item with a nublado instance in Chile to allow ad-hoc analysis
       \end{itemize}
   \item transferring data to NCSA and ingesting with a few-second latency and 100\% reliability,
         or at least logging
   \begin{itemize}
      \item mirroring or copying the EFD
   \end{itemize}
   \item automatically processing suitable data as it arrives
   \begin{itemize}
      \item presumably using gen3
      \item N.b. will require us to establish conventions on ``suitable data''
   \end{itemize}
   \item running automated calibration scripts
   \begin{itemize}
      \item including QA
   \end{itemize}
   \item doing something with the results of the QA
   \item using the RSP to look at data
   \begin{itemize}
      \item including EFD access
      \item and a decently-high up time and performance.
   \end{itemize}
   \item things I haven't thought of yet
\end{itemize}


Quite a lot of this doesn't exist, and may have to be moved out to a later IM depending on resource
availability.  I suspect there'll be push-back on some of this because doing things this way isn't the way
that it was planned (or really not planned, but written down in silos).  In some cases this will be
reasonable, for example we may decide that some fraction of CCS configuration is indeed better carried out by
logging into CCS nodes.
